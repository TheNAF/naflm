Copy new files into proper directorys then run update.php. This creates new table columns required to track new stats.

Added Spike 6 data. Also added all star players to team rosters so they can be rostered. You still need to 'induce' the star players on the match data page to properly track their stats. Do not give the rostered stars any SPP or other games stats, induce them and do it the old way.

Also added ability for Admin to deduct FF for redraft purposes. This affects 'won' FF, not 'bought' FF for which there is already an admin tool.

Coaches can add 'seasons played' and set a flag for each player when they decide they want to retire as per BB2016 redrafting rules. Admin function to undo coach changes as well.
Automatically calculates the Incentive required to rehire a retiring player next season.
